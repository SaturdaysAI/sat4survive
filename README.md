Localize indentify small boats on the sea

We're using sat public parametric data for radiance to identify possible small boats on movement or static

The goal is to democratize this info vs. private plattforms or not public data as FRONTEX, and other commercial.

To approach this fit, we're thinking about subpixel resolution propietary technologies and equivalent convolution network.

Hard work was to make training and test dataset from official sources (this info becomes public and can be downloaded)
